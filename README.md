# Git Practice Repo
### This Repo is solely dedicated to practice Git.

You are always welcome to take part into this. To make the practice more realistic, it is also a good idea to try it as a Team.</br>
#### Here is a Summary of what I've tried till now:
1. Git init, Git add, Git commit.
2. Linux Commands: cd, mkdir, touch, etc.
3. git remote add origin
4. git push, pull, clone.
5. git status
